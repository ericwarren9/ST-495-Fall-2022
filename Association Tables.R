# Purpose: Testing for association in 2 or 3 way tables


# Testing independence in 2-way tables ----------------------------------

data.cars <- mtcars

x1 <- mtcars$cyl
x2 <- mtcars$vs

table(x1)
table(x2)

# Test for association: use the chi-square test
data.table <- table(x1,x2)
data.table


# Testing independence in 2-way tables ------------------------------------

chisq.test(data.table)
# strictly speaking, assumptions for the test are violated here 
# as cell entries are less than 5 in several cases

# When the sample size is low, we can apply the Fisher's exact test 
# instead of Chi-Square test.
fisher.test(data.table)

# Three categorical variables
data.ucb <- UCBAdmissions

# let's ignore dept for a second
table.ucb <- margin.table(data.ucb, c(1, 2))
table.ucb

# for male applicants
1198 / (1198 + 1493)

# for female applicants
557 / (557 + 1278)

# let's run the chi-square test
chisq.test(table.ucb)


# Looking at tables more closely ------------------------------------------

# Department A
data.ucb[, , 1]

# for male applicants
512 / (512 + 313)

# for female applicants
89 / (89 + 19)

# For dept A, females applicants actually have a higher success rate

# Department F
data.ucb[, , 6]

# for male applicants
22 / (22 + 351)

# for female applicants
24 / (24 + 317)
